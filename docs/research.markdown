I research, design, and develop equitable and inclusive technologies and research interventions for broadening participation in computer and information science. See below for a list of active research projects.

## Accessible Education and E-Learining Technologies

Achieving equity and inclusion in education entails examining areas in learning that limit or deny participation or access for learners with disabilities. For example, online learning (e-learning) provides a flexible and convenient alternative to traditional classroom instruction; however, the accessibility of e-learning technologies such as learning management systems (LMS) and video-based tutorials for persons with visual impairments is largely unknown. Further research is needed to assess further how educational and e-learning technologies can be (re)designed for a more accessible user experience for learners with disabilities.

## Broadening Participation in STEM + Computing

As jobs in the STEM industry (including) surge in availability, the number of eligible candidates to fill such jobs do not meet the demand, especially in the tech industry. Research points to the lack of diversity in the candidate pool. Thus, efforts are being made to include people from historically underrepresented groups in STEM careers.

## Equitable and Inclusive Design of ICT

As society strives to create technology usable for all potential consumers, we have to ask ourselves, “Are we including all potential consumers in the design of our technology?” Achieving high user experience (UX) in products involves addressing the limitations of users and leveraging their strengths in design. Beyond the technical considerations, we, as researchers and designers, must also examine the social and human factors that impact how products may discriminate against one or more user groups.
